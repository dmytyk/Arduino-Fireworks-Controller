# Fireworks-Controller
<u>Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 Web Based Fireworks Controller</u> 

My family and I love Fireworks and I love Building things with Arduino products.  What better way to combine both loves then to build a Fireworks Controller.
 There are lots of commercial products available and I am sure there are several micro controller products already out there, but hey one more can't hurt.

<b>Old School Method:</b>

I would lay out several rows of fireworks and effects, fuse them together then get up from my chair and light them one at a time.  Lighting fireworks is fun sitting back with a cocktail and enjoying the show with the family is lot more fun (hey what's wrong with mixing booze and explosives, really what could go wrong)!


<b>Fancy Pants Arduino Method:</b>

I wanted a Web Based product to use at my house (uses my home WiFi) that would set off several rows, one at a time as I directed.
