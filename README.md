# Fireworks-Controller

### Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 Web Based Fireworks Controller
My family and I love Fireworks and I love building things with Arduino products.  What better way to combine both loves then to build a Fireworks Controller.
 There are lots of commercial products available and I am sure there are several micro controller products already out there, but hey one more can't hurt.

### Old School Method:
I would lay out different fireworks and effects one row at a time. At show time I would get up from my chair light the row, run back to my chair, then do that again and again, you get the picture.  Lighting fireworks is fun but sitting back with a cocktail and enjoying the show with the family is lot more fun (hey what's wrong with mixing booze and explosives, really what could go wrong)!

### Fancy Pants Arduino Method:
Build a Web Based controller that would fire off several rows, one at a time as I directed, while sitting with the family and enjoy the show together.
